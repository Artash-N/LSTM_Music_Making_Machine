# LSTM_Music_Making_Machine
Using LSTM Reccurent Neural Networks to create a musical response to a tune played on a virtual piano. Coded with Python3 and Tensorflow

#

You must use anaconda for this program, or install the libaries with only pip

Before running the code, please install the following libaries with pip and conda:

1. Tensorflow: conda install tensorflow   (If you have an NVIDIA GPU: conda install tensorflow-gpu)

2. Keras: conda install keras

3. Pygame: conda install -c cogsci pygame

4. MIDO : pip install mido

#

We will be using a 2 layer LSTM neural network to create musical responces to tune played by a user on a virtual piano. This code is built in python 3.7, and uses Tensorflow and Keras for the model architecture. 

It is reccomended to train this model with a NVIDIA GPU that suppord CUDA for a faster training experience. It took 3 - 4 days of training to achieve its full potential, but it will work with just 24 hours to.
